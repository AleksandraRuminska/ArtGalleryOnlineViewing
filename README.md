# ArtGalleryOnlineViewing
Software imitating the visit in an online museum/art gallery. 

It has the features of both - command line application for gathering input data and printing messages and graphical user interface for viewing the paintings and moving to the next one.

The user can be a Tourist or a Buyer (it's a class that extends the Tourist) and sightsee the paintings in the museum or, in case of a Buyer, even buy them, but not while they have a status of being in restoration. 

The game was created for the classes at University. The code was written in Java with the use of elements from Swing. More functionality will be added in the future.

The examples of the paintings were taken from the https://unsplash.com/s/photos/painting website.

The more extended version of the project can be found at: https://gitlab.com/alexrumi2000/artgallery.
